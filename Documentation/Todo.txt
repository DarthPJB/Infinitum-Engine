@todo Main

Add full Shader Support
Mesh-offsets
Input System
Scene manager
Loading / spash screen.
Questions: 
Consider creation of a 'plugin manager' plugin that loads plugins from folder
VS
Adding plugin folder-loading to existing loader-code

Done:

Add texture support
Consider how to sucessfully handle shaders per-renderer. eg: transform shader combination, etc.
Create demonstration simplistic shader.
Change plugin loader to not not require an exact match between plugin name and module names
Possibly make plugin's self-register? (internal Register****()) call within plugin?
Change plugin loader to return a plugin-manager object (rather than the current stupid system)
Simplify plugin-loader code (relevant to addition of new plugin types)
Mesh Optimisation function
Render system Optimisation function
Non-render meshes
fix model-use to deal with array pointers
Interleaved Meshes
Consider back-porting Space-engine model format (Don't re-invent the wheel dammit)
Implement OBJ file-type plugin
Add model-render code to render system
